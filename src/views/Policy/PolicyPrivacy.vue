              you provide with the information we already have on file, or we may contact you through a communication method (e.g. phone or email) 
              that you have previously provided to us. We may also use other verification methods as the circumstances dictate.
            </p>
            <p>
              We will only use personal information provided in your request to verify your identity or authority to make the request. 
              To the extent possible, we will avoid requesting additional information from you for the purposes of verification. If, however, 
              if we cannot verify your identity from the information already maintained by us, we may request that you provide additional information for the 
              purposes of verifying your identity, and for security or fraud-prevention purposes. We will delete such additionally provided information
